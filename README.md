# mp3chapters.github.io

Online tool for adding chapters and other `id3` tags to audio files such as podcasts. Available at [mp3chapters.github.io](https://mp3chapters.github.io). It also features a [tool for merging audio files](https://mp3chapters.github.io/merge/).

Uses just HTML/CSS and vanilla JS. No server-side code, so it can be run by just starting a webserver in the repo directory (e.g. `python3 -m http.server`). To avoid duplicating images, the tool uses hashes made with subtlecrypto. This feature is only available in https and `localhost`.
